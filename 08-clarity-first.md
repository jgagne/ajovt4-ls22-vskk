## Brief

> Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard.
>
> —[David McCullough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McCullough), author, narrator, and lecturer

Author a single-page document that explores your thesis focusing on content and clarity first with the following sections:

- Title
- Summary
- Mind Map
- Keywords
- Key Points
- References

### Details

- See [Format](#format) for content requirements and comments.

### Notes

#### Voice & Tone

Academic voice avoids informal language and utilizes an authoritative tone. It’s not personal, but remember to write for humans; keep it concise using plain, accessible English.

- See [Academic Voice](#academic-voice) examples.

#### Keywords

Keywords are a tool to help indexers and search engines find relevant content.

Keywords should:

- Represent the content of your work
- Be specific to your field, topic, etc.

## Handoff

Use the same repo as the previous semester and continue the order (and naming convention).

### Setup

  - For example:
    - `08-clarity-first`
      - `index.md`
      -  `img`
          - `thesis-mind-map.png`

### Format
